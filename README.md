# Cloud Robotics RFCs
[Cloud Robotics RFCs]: #cloud-robotics-rfcs

For changes more substantial than simple bugfixes and documentation improvements
we ask that these be put through a very lightweight design review process.

"RFC" stands for "request for comments" and are used, e.g. by
[rust-lang](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs), to establish a consistent
and controlled path for new features to enter their project, so that new
contributors can anticipate the short- and long-term development roadmap of the
project.

## When should you write an RFC
[When should you write an RFC]: #when-should-you-write-an-rfc

You should provide an RFC if you intend to make a *significant* change or
contribution to one of Cloud Robotic's repositories. A change is
*significant* if it introduces a new *concept* or modifies an existing
*concept*. The process is really very lightweight so we encourage you to err on
the side of creating RFCs.

Make sure to have *one sentence per line* in the RFC as it makes reading diffs
much easier. There is no characters per line limit for RFCs.

## Motivation for RFCs
[Motivation for RFCs]: #motivation-for-rfcs

Before the introduction of RFCs reviewer's would sometimes spend time reading
incoming PRs trying to find out what the problem is the author is actually
solving. This could slow down reviews considerably which is unfortunate for both
the reviewer and contributor.

Sometimes a PR could sit in the review queue for a long time as it was modifying
code that was undergoing a refactoring and merging it would make that
refactoring harder. So the purpose of a RFC is both to vet incoming feature
proposals and also allow other contributors to learn about on-going projects
and coordinate better.

## Before creating an RFC
[Before creating an RFC]: #before-creating-an-rfc

Before opening an RFC we ask you to briefly look over the list of RFCs being
discussed or implemented. If your RFC conflicts with another RFC please inject
yourself into the discussion by either commenting on the RFCs PR or opening an
issue about the RFC being implemented in this repository.

## What the process is
[What the process is]: #what-the-process-is

Follow this process to get your feature merged into Cloud Robotics.

  - Fork the RFC repo [RFC repository]
  - Copy `0000-template.md` to `text/0000-my-feature.md` (where "my-feature" is
    descriptive. Don't assign an RFC number yet).
  - Fill in the RFC.
  - Submit a pull request. As a pull request the RFC will receive design
    feedback from the larger community, and the author should be prepared to
    revise it in response.
  - When consensus about the RFC has been reached the corresponding PR will be
    approved and the PR merged.
  - When you create implementing PRs, please add a link to the RFC in the PR
    description.
